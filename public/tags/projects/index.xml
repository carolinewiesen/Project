      <description>Projects Here are some projects I have recently completed:
  Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools
  Modeling, Testing, and Classification
  The first project investigates the relationship between level of education and insurance. I wanted to see if having more education would indicate having a greater chance of being insured in life.
The second project is all about sports- specifically Stephen Curry in teh NBA. I looked into the 2016-2017 season and wanted to see if there was any correlation to with, let&amp;rsquo;s say, winning the game and the amount of points he scored per game.</description>
