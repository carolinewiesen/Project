      <description>Hello everyone! I hope you enjoy learning about me and the statistical analyses I have worked on in the past. I think it’s really cool!
I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin and am part of the class of 2021. I study biology and am also in the UTeach program where I am getting my composite science certification to teach 7th-12th grade levels. My dream is to teach 7th grade life science.</description>

      <description>Here’s a picture of my dog, Scooter, because I think he’s pretty awesome.
What even is coding? There are many different coding systems that are used to interpret various statistical methods, but two systems that are great for statistical investigations are “R” and “Python”. Although these two methods for statistical analysis are similar in some ways, they are also very different in the way they code. But, Python code can still work while using the R application- so learning both “languages” of code can be very helpful for statistical analysis!</description>

I decided to investigate the relationship between education and those that have or do not have insurance for the reasons listed prior.</description>

      <description>Projects Here are some projects I have recently completed:
  Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools
  Modeling, Testing, and Classification
  The first project investigates the relationship between level of education and insurance. I wanted to see if having more education would indicate having a greater chance of being insured in life.
The second project is all about sports- specifically Stephen Curry in the NBA. I looked into the 2016-2017 season and wanted to see if there was any correlation to with, let&amp;rsquo;s say, winning the game and the amount of points he scored per game.</description>
