What even is coding? There are many different coding systems that are used to interpret various statistical methods, but two systems that are great for statistical investigations are “R” and “Python”. Although these two methods for statistical analysis are similar in some ways, they are also very different in the way they code. But, Python code can still work while using the R application- so learning both “languages” of code can be very helpful for statistical analysis!</description>
