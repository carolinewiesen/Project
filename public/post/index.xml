      <description>Hello everyone! I hope you enjoy learning about me and the statistical analyses I have worked on in the past. I think itâ€™s really cool!
I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin and am part of the class of 2021. I study biology and am also in the UTeach program where I am getting my composite science certification to teach 7th-12th grade levels. My dream is to teach 7th grade life science.</description>
