Hello everyone! I hope you enjoy learning about me and the statistical analyses I have worked on in the past. I think it's really cool! 

I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin and am part of the class of 2021. I study biology and am also in the UTeach program where I am getting my composite science certification for 7th-12th grade levels. My dream is to teach 7th grade life science. 

I love sports and one of my hobbies is specifically watching and playing basketball. I am a big fan of the NBA (and the Houston Rockets!). 

Please reach out to me if you have any questions or want to hear more about my work.
