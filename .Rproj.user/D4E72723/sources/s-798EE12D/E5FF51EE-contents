## Projects 

Here are some projects I have recently completed:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools](/project1/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification](/project2/)

The first project investigates the relationship between level of education and insurance. I wanted to see if having more education would indicate having a greater chance of being insured in life. 

The second project is all about sports- specifically Stephen Curry in teh NBA. I looked into the 2016-2017 season and wanted to see if there was any correlation to with, let's say, winning the game and the amount of points he scored per game.
