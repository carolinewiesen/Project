Education has always been very interesting to me- I am an inspiring biology teacher and love to gather more information on education. I decided to investigate the relationship between education and those that have or do not have insurance for the reasons listed prior. Insurance is a very important aspect for living, and I wanted to see if the degree of education one obtains is related to the proportion of insurance for each county in Texas. I assumed that there is a correlation since insurance costs money and a higher education degree most likely leads to a higher salary. 

  The datasets that I have are called "education" and "insurance"; education has 7 variables that give the proportion of those that do not have a high school degree and those that have a high school degree, college, bachelor's, masters, professional, and doctorate degree. The insurance dadatset has three variables that describe the proportion of those that have insurance from ages 0-19, 18-64, and total under 65 years. I got these datasets from Social Explorer through the UT library.


```{R}

education1 <- education %>% pivot_longer(c("Anderson County, Texas":"Wilson County, Texas"), names_to = "county", values_to="percent") %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "education", values_from = "percent")

insurance1 <- insurance %>% pivot_longer(c("Anderson County, Texas":"Wilson County, Texas"), names_to = "county", values_to="percent") %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "insurance", values_from = "percent")

```

In order to have the variables in the right places, I had to swtich them around for each dataset. For example, the county names were originally on the y axis and the varaibles that I had listed for the education dataset were on the x axis. By using the function pivot_longer, I was able to accomplish this for both datasets. 

```{R}
project <- insurance1 %>% full_join(education1)
names(project) <- c("county", "young_ins", "middle_ins", "no_insurance_all", "lths", "hs", "college", "bachelor", "masters", "prof", "doct")
project <- project %>% mutate(range_of_insurance=case_when(no_insurance_all < 0.260 ~ "Low", no_insurance_all > 0.260 ~ "High"))
```

I used full_join to join my datasets since I knew that the counties in each dataset were the same and wanted to keep all the rows in case there may have been one that I didn't account for. I would then be able to notice this mistake after joining the datasets. There were no rows that were dropped after joining.  

```{r}
project %>% summarize(mean_lths_edu=mean(lths, na.rm=T), min_lths_edu=min(lths, na.rm = T))
project %>% group_by(county)
project %>% arrange(desc(county)) %>% select(county, contains("ins"))
project %>% mutate('no_insurance_pctile'=ntile(no_insurance_all,100))
project %>% filter(lths==.174)

project %>% group_by(range_of_insurance, county) %>% summarize(max_masters=max(masters))
project %>% group_by(county) %>% summarize(min_masters=min(masters))
project %>% group_by(range_of_insurance, county) %>% summarize(max_college=max(college))
project %>% group_by(range_of_insurance, county) %>% summarize(mean(prof))
project %>% summarize(max(no_insurance_all))
project %>% summarize(max(doct))
project %>% summarize(min(bachelor))
project %>% summarize(min(lths))
project%>% group_by(range_of_insurance, county) %>% summarize(max(lths))
project %>% summary(no_insurance_all)

mydata <- project[c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)]
head(mydata)
round((cor(mydata)), 2)
```

I renamed each variable so the name would be shorter than it originally was. Here are the new names: young_ins (Persons Without Insurance (Population Under 19 Years), middle_ins (Persons Without Insurance (Population 18 to 64 Years), no_insurance_all (Persons Without Insurance (Population Under 65 Years), lths (less than high school), high school (high school graduate or more), college (some college or more), bachelor (Bachelor's degree or more), masters (master's degree or more), prof (professional school degree or more), and doct (doctorate degree). Using the dplyr functions, the results for mean_lths_edu was 0.168, min_lths_edu 0.07, max doct 0.055, min bachelor 0.1, min lths .07, max no_insurance_all .307. I then arranged the counties in descending order and picked out the variables with the letters "ins" in them; I also found the percentile of those that don't have insurance for each county. After using the filter function, I found that there are 3 counties with the same proportion of "lths" and "hs" degree holders.   

```{r}
ggplot(project, aes(x=county))+geom_bar(aes(y=bachelor, fill=range_of_insurance), stat="summary", fun.y="mean")+theme(legend.position = "right")+coord_flip()
ggplot(project, aes(county, lths, color=no_insurance_all))+geom_point()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1),legend.position="left")+scale_color_gradient(low="yellow", high="red")
project%>%select_if(is.numeric)%>%cor%>%as.data.frame%>%rownames_to_column%>%pivot_longer(-1)%>%ggplot(aes(rowname,name,fill=value))+geom_tile()+ geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)))+xlab("Variable 1")+ylab("Variable 2") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=rel(.5), angle=90), axis.text.y=element_text(size=rel(.5)))
```

The first graph shows the relationship between bachelor degree holders and the range of insurance grouped by county. This graph shows that as the proportion of those with bachelor degrees (or more) increases, then the range of insurance is mostly considered "low". This title of "low" means that there are not a lot of people in the county that do not have insurance (less than .26 of the population does not have insurance) and the title "high" means that more than .26 of the population does not have insurance. So, those with a bachelors degree or more have a better chance of having insurance since a smaller proportion of the population having no insurance equates to a higher proportion of bachelor degree holders.
The second graph shows the relationship between those that didn't graduate high school ("lths") and those that don't have insurance (no_insurance_all) grouped by county. The color gradient is from yellow-orange-red. The yellow dots represent a smaller proportion of those without insurance (more insurance in county) and the red dots represent a larger proportion of those without insurance. As you can see, there are more red dots towards the top of the y axis indicating that those that didn't graduate high school have a higher chance of not having insurance. The yellowish dots are towards the bottom which shows that the fewer the frequency of not graduating from high school, the smaller the chance for not having insurance.
The last plot is a correlation heat map of the numeric variables in the "project" dataset. These boxes show the correlation between each numeric variable. The darker the blue indicates the less correlated the numeric variables are. The lighter the blue indicates the more correlation. The lowest correlation is between the lths and hs variables (graduated less than high school and graduated high school). This makes sense because these two variables are completely inverse. If 10% of the population did not graduate from high school, then 90% of the population must have. If 85% of the population did not graduate from high school, then 15% did. The highest correlation between one of the insurance variables and education variables is the middle_ins (people without insurance between the ages of 18-64) and lths (less than high school education) at a total of 0.67. Once again, this makes sense because those that did not graduate from high school are most liekly not expected to have insurance. 

```{r}
sil_width<-vector()
for(i in 2:10){
pam_fit <- project%>%select(young_ins, middle_ins, no_insurance_all, lths, hs, college, bachelor, masters, prof, doct)%>%pam(i)
sil_width[i] <- pam_fit$silinfo$avg.width}
ggplot()+geom_line(aes(x=1:10,y=sil_width))+scale_x_continuous(name="k",breaks=1:10)
pam2<-project%>%select(young_ins, middle_ins, no_insurance_all, lths, hs, college, bachelor, masters, prof, doct)%>%pam(2)
pam2
final<-project%>%mutate(cluster=as.factor(pam2$clustering))
confmat<-final%>%count(cluster)%>%arrange(desc(n))%>%pivot_wider(names_from="cluster",values_from="n",values_fill = list('n'=0))
confmat
ggplot(final, aes(x=hs,y=college, color=cluster))+geom_point()

library(GGally)
project %>% mutate(cluster=as.factor(pam2$clustering)) %>% ggpairs(columns = 2:8, aes(color=cluster))
plot(pam2,which=2)
```

After running the code, I found that the appropriate number of clusters to be 2. The ggplot showed that the highest sil_width was at a value of k=2. I used this cluster number to produce a variety of graphs after loading the GGally library. These graphs show the correlation between certain variables. The same relationship between lths and hs is shown here as it was on the correlation heat map. My cluster solution is not amazing and considered reasonable since the average solhouette width is 0.51. These clusters and graphs shown are a reflection of the heat map correlation. Two of the variables shown here have a negative correlation- college (college degree or more) and no_insurance_all (amount of county that doesn't have insurance). These two variables show that as bachelor degrees increase, the frequency of those without insurance decreases.
